Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning.

Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x).

This regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output).

It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.

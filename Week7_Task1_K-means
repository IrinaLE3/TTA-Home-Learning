K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm which attempts to divide data into k discrete groups and is effective at uncovering basic data patterns.

Examples of potential groupings include animal species, customers with similar features, and housing market segmentation.

The k-means clustering algorithm works by first splitting data into k number of clusters with k representing the number of clusters you wish to create. If you choose

to split your dataset into three clusters then k, for example, is set to 3

 
How does k-means clustering separate the data points? The first step is to examine the unclustered data on the scatterplot and manually select a centroid

for each k cluster. That centroid then forms the epicenter of an individual cluster.

The remaining data points on the scatterplot are then assigned to the closest centroid by measuring the Euclidean distance.

The next step is to update each centroid by calculating the average x and y values of all data points for a cluster.

After that each data point is re-visited, distance between the data point and each updated centroid is calculated and the data point is assigned to the cluster 

with the closest centroid. In most cases it will be same cluster as before but some data point could switch clusters.

 Should any data point switch clusters, the previous step is repeated. Once we reach a stage where the data points no longer switch clusters after

an update in centroid coordinates, the algorithm is complete, and we have the final set of clusters.

The K-means clustering algorithm is used to find groups which have not been explicitly labeled in the data.

This can be used to confirm business assumptions about what types of groups exist or to identify unknown groups in complex data sets
